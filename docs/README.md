# Introduction

A collection of unexpected challenges and learnings with [nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/). The provided examples reflect my journey in learning nextflow and generally assume an intermediate familiarity with nextflow.

## Gotchas

The gotchas are typically provided as minimal, reproducible examples (MREs) with additional explanations. What is a minimal, reproducible example?

As explained very well on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example):

> Your code examples should be
>
> -   Minimal – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
> -   Complete – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
> -   Reproducible – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome and I very much aim for this to be a community-driven project. [Phil Ewels](https://github.com/ewels/) and I are already talking about how to best integrate these examples into the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/). Please [open an issue on the repository](https://github.com/Midnighter/nextflow-gotchas/issues) or message me on either of the Slack teams linked in the footer regarding any examples, ideas, or suggestions that you may have.
