# Nextflow Gotchas

A collection of unexpected challenges and learnings with [nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/).

## Minimal, Reproducible Examples

What is a minimal, reproducible example? As explained very well on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example):

> Your code examples should be
>
> * Minimal – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
> * Complete – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
> * Reproducible – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem
