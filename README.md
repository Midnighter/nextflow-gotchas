# Nextflow Gotchas

A collection of unexpected challenges and learnings with [nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/). The provided examples reflect my journey in learning nextflow and generally assume an intermediate familiarity with nextflow.

The contents of this repository are best enjoyed from https://midnighter.github.io/nextflow-gotchas. The site is generated using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and organized as follows:

-   [`docs/`](docs/) contains the markdown source files
-   [`examples/`](examples/) holds the nextflow workflows

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome and I very much aim for this to be a community-driven project. Please [open an issue on the repository](https://github.com/Midnighter/nextflow-gotchas/issues) if you have a good example, an idea, or any other suggestion.
